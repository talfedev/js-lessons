## lesson 2
- comments
```javascript
// one line comments
/* multi line comments */
```

- variable names are case sensitive, so the following variables are different from each other
```javascript
let name;
let Name;
```

you can declare a few variables at once:<br />
// without values<br />
```javascript
let firstName, lastName, age;
```

//with values<br />
```javascript
let firstName = "Ethan", lastName = "hunt", age = "30";
```
