## lesson 2
• comments
- // one line comments
- /* multi line comments */

• variable names are case sensitive, so the following variables are different from each other
- let name;
- let Name;

you can declare a few variables at once:<br />
// without values
let firstName, lastName, age;

//with values
let firstName = "Ethan", lastName = "hunt", age = "30";
